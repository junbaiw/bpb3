         make_cluster4pwm       Make input PWM files for bpb3 based on clustered PWMs.
         bpb3selectedPWM        The second level analysis of bpb3 by using the top PWMs in TF ranking after the first level analysis of bpb3 based on the clustered PWMs. 
         run_pipeline           Run full bpb3 pipeline (e.g., the first level analysis of bpb3 if clustered PWMs are used in the calculation).

## Notes

1. Demo1 and demo2 were used in papers 1 and 3.
2. Demo3, demo4, demo5, and demo6 were used in papers 2 and 3.
3. Demo7 was similar to the calculation in paper 4, but the 14 FL samples were replaced by an independent FL cohort from papers 2 and 3.
4. Under final_demo_data, the pwm folder contains 1772 human pwms that were used in papers 1, 2, 3, and 4.
5. Applications of clustered PWMs in demos 2, 4, and 5 are described in current paper 5.
